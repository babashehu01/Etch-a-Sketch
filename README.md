# Etch a Sketch
## This is my implementation of the famous Etch-a-Sketch kids game.

# Technologies Used

# Features
This game takes a size of grid as an input, and draws the grid based on that size.
It can take a maximum of 100*100 grid size for memory efficiency.
The grid changes color on each mouse hover.
It starts with background colour of white, and then it turns completely black after 10 interactions/hovers.
